1.  Vehicle Mileage decrease as increase in Horsepower , engine-size, Curb Weight
2.  As horsepower increase the engine size increases
3.  Curbweight increases with the increase in Engine Size
4.  engine size and curb-weight is positively co realted with price
5.  city-mpg is negatively corelated with price as increase horsepower reduces the mileage
